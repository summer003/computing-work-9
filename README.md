Dear Teachers,
Thank you  for being so patient and caring towards us. 
You have given us a lot of knowledge and taught us a lot of values.
Although you nag at us sometimes, I know that you did it out of care and want us to follow the rules that will help us prepare for a better future.
You also give us punishments but I know that you do it because you want us to take responsiblity for our own actions just like how we have to do so in the future when we are working as adults.
